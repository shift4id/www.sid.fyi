### Starting Off
I started this site by first deciding what content I wanted to have on the site.

- Home Page with links to socials much like [my old site](https://2019.sid.fyi)
- Blog to dump random thoughts I have or stuff that I write about
- Projects page to showcase a few of the projects I've worked on
- Photos page to share some of my favorite pictures that I've taken
- Music page to show some songs I have been listening to
- Setup page to flex my keyboard collection
- Contact page to give anyone an easy way to say hello

### Deciding on a Stack
I was heavily debating between two options:

1. A HTML/CSS/JS site with emphasis on animations
2. An extremely minimal Next.js site

Option 2 fit my needs much better based on the content I had wanted to show on the site, so instead of overthinking, I decided to go with it.

### Starting to Code
I started by using create-next-app, then adding in everything I knew I would need:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the [Airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) style guide to keep my code clean
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) to reduce CSS bundle size
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) on [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) for API Caching
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for the beautiful icons

From there, I decided to jump in and begin with the API routes.
I set up my utility functions, then I did a bit of exploration with redis caching as that was one of my learning goals wit this project.
Below, you can see the result!

```js
import redis from "@/lib/redis";
import { getCurrentlyPlaying } from "@/lib/spotify";

const handler = async (_, res) => {
  const storedSong = JSON.parse(await redis.get("song"));

  if (storedSong) return res.status(200).json(storedSong);

  const response = await getCurrentlyPlaying();

  if (response.status === 204 || response.status > 400) {
    const song = { isPlaying: false };
    await redis.set("song", JSON.stringify(song), "EX", 1);
    return res.status(200).json({ isPlaying: false });
  }

  const { item, is_playing: isPlaying } = await response.json();

  const song = {
    isPlaying,
    artist: item.artists.map((artist) => artist.name).join(", "),
    image: item.album.images[0].url,
    title: item.name,
    url: item.external_urls.spotify,
  };

  await redis.set("song", JSON.stringify(song), "EX", 1);
  return res.status(200).json(song);
};

export default handler;
```

After I was happy with the code, I was ready to test it. I began by coding the ["index"](/) route which displays my now playing.

I realized however, that the page kept re-rendering, so I decided to break it into a "currently-playing" component.
After that issue was fixed, I added a clock because I thought it might be useful for those who contact me to know when I may not be available.
Learning from my experience with the "currently-playing" component I made a new "time" component.
Then, I finished off by putting in everything I had in [my old site](https://2019.sid.fyi).

Moving forward, I added in the gradients...
This was quite a difficult process as choosing lots of nice gradients can be very difficult.
What I had decided to do, was instead of hard-coding gradients, I would dynamically generate them.
I had made an object which told my scipt which colors not to put next to each other and you can see all of the possible gradients [here](/gradients).


Once this was done, I made the base page [layout](/layout), then I populated my content.
After that, there was just a bit of minor cleanup and I was ready to deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)!

Thanks for making it all the way to the end! Please [email](mailto:hi@sid.fyi) me any feedback.
